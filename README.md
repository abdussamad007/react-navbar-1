* Main challenge to work with any UI Technology and fraemwork is version compatibility.
* Check which version you need , and install accordingly. I am using node 24.5.0
* From VSCode terminal check which node you have using ` node -v ` commnad returns v24.5.0
* To use any specific node version use ` nvm use node 24 `
* Check react version ` npm view react version ` , returns 19.1.1. Same you can check from package.json file in your project.
